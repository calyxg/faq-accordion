### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt to use details and summary elements to build the accordion component and used JS to close all other accordion items except the one that was currently active. Adding progressive enhancements to the shadowDOM element allowed me to include transitions on open and close of the accordion which can be seen using browsers that currently support this functionality.

### Useful resources

- [web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/html/details) - This clearly outlines the details and summary elements and how to use them.
